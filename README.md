# ziibra_code_test
Coding test for Ziibra. A user can paste a big group of emails with names into the text field, which will then populate a linkbox with addresses and names formated as: John Doe &lt;johndoe@me.com&gt;. It validates emails, and handles various types of delimiters, quotes, no-name, etc. It does not use any libraries, just Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3.
